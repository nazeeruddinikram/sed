Sed scripts.

cat, fold, head, rev, tac, tail, uniq, wc
    are implementations of the unix commands (no opts)

longest
    outputs longest line in the input
    
palindromes
    outputs all palindromes in input (lines that are the same forward and backwords)
    
parentheses
    checks if the parentheses () match over the input

nsum
    sums integer input: accepts positive/negative numbers, one line per integer

Any of these can be run as an executable script as normal, assuming you have sed in /bin/sed
